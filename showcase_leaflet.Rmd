### Leaflet

<https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet>

Leaflet is a JavaScript library for creating dynamic maps that support panning and zooming, with various annotations like markers, polygons, and popups.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Example from http://geog.uoregon.edu/geogr/topics/maps01.html
load('geog495.RData')
```

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
pal <- colorQuantile("YlOrRd", NULL, n = 8)
leaflet(orstationc) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(color = ~pal(tann))
```
