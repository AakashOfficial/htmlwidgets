### Plotly
<https://plot.ly/r/>

Plotly allows you to easily translate your ggplot2 graphics to an interactive web-based version, and also provides bindings to the [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/) graphing library.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
            geom_bar(position = "dodge")
ggplotly(p)
```

The R package also provides high-level bindings for working directly with [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/).

```{r, message=FALSE}
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 500), ]
plot_ly(d, x = carat, y = price, text = paste("Clarity: ", clarity),
        mode = "markers", color = carat, size = carat)
```
